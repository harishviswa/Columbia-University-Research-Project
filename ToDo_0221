Hi Harish,

I really like your work. Thanks for coming up with this interesting project. Here are a few to-do's:

1. Change the EDA file into an html notebook (like what you usually do for coding assignments) so that the outputs are displayed. 
2. In the EDA, add a few sentence to explain what each column (variable) means.
3. So my understanding of your project based on the proposal is that you'd like to (1) predict the probability of injury based on the collected variables; and, if possible (2) predict rehabilitation timeline.
Correct? Since the scope of (1) and (2) are different, please clarify. 

Thanks!
